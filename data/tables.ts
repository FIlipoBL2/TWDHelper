  "TheWalkingDeadUniverseRPG": {
    "Overview": {
      "GameType": "The Walking Dead Universe Roleplaying Game is a tabletop roleplaying game where players struggle to survive in a hostile world, facing impossible choices and exploring their character's inner selves. The game takes place in The Walking Dead Universe, the same setting as AMC Networks' television series.",
      "Participants": "The game involves a Game Master (GM) and typically two to five players. The GM controls all Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and the overall world, while players create and control Player Characters (PCs).",
      "Goal": "The objective is not to 'win' by surviving indefinitely, but to roleplay your PC in a way that aligns with your expressive goals and playgroup's dynamic, even if it means making dangerous choices for dramatic effect. The game emphasizes storytelling and character development over strict adherence to rules, encouraging collaborative interpretation of dice rolls to serve the narrative.",
      "MaterialsNeeded": "Beyond the rulebook, players need pens, paper, and ten to twenty six-sided dice. Five of these dice should be a different color to serve as 'stress dice'. Custom dice are available but not required.",
      "GameModes": "The game can be played in two modes: Campaign Mode or Survival Mode. Sessions typically last a few hours, comparable to a TV episode.",
      "SafetyTools": "The game deals with dark and existential themes, and the use of safety tools (like pre-game discussions on 'lines and veils', safety cards during play, and post-game debriefings) is recommended to ensure all players feel safe and comfortable."
    },
    "TheWorldOfTheDead": {
      "Setting": "The game is set in the post-apocalyptic United States, specifically focusing on suburban Atlanta for campaign settings, but it can be adapted to any location worldwide. The timeline can be set at any point after the outbreak, before, during, or after any season of the television series.",
      "TheOutbreak": "The apocalypse began with the 'Wildfire Virus' around the early 2010s, which makes everyone reanimate as a walker upon death, regardless of how they die. Walker bites or scratches are lethal due to infection, requiring immediate limb amputation as the only hope of survival. Widespread chaos and panic ensued, leading to the collapse of society and futile military attempts (like Operation: Cobalt) to contain the undead.",
      "TheWalkers": "Walkers are ubiquitous and driven solely by the compulsion to devour living flesh. They are a constant threat, like a force of nature, and while individual walkers can be killed, their sheer numbers make eliminating them impossible. A gathering of walkers forms a 'swarm' that moves as one and can destroy nearly anything in its path. Walkers have poor eyesight but heightened hearing and smell, and are alerted by bright light, foreign scents, and loud noises. They do not evolve or heal but continuously decompose, becoming more withered and damaged over time.",
      "TheLiving": "Other survivors pose a significant threat, often more so than walkers, due to scarcity of resources leading to conflict. Survivors have committed 'inhuman things' to stay alive. While cannibals, robbers, and murderers exist, there are also those seeking to trade, join groups, or rebuild society. Survivors form 'havens' for safety and resource gathering, ranging from tents to fortified bases. Larger, more advanced communities like the Civic Republic exist but are often secretive and can be malevolent towards outsiders.",
      "Nature": "Post-outbreak, nature is reclaiming the world, with wildlife and vegetation thriving in urban areas. This provides game, fish, and edible plants, but also introduces new predators."
    },
    "PlayerCharacters": {
      "Concept": "PCs are ordinary people who survived the initial collapse. The core difference between them and those who perished is their 'Drive'. The game is about a collective group of survivors, not individual heroes, and conflicts within the group (both PCs and NPCs) can be as dangerous as external threats.",
      "CoreAspects": {
        "Archetype": "Represents who your PC was before the outbreak (e.g., Criminal, Doctor, Farmer, Homemaker, Kid, Law Enforcer, Nobody, Outcast, Politician, Preacher, Scientist, Soldier). It serves as a starting point and inspiration, losing mechanical effect after play begins.",
        "Issue": "A problematic or challenging aspect of your PC's person (e.g., alcoholic, trusting too easily, loneliness). Issues help with roleplaying and provide the GM with inspiration for 'Challenges' in the story. Issues can change, and a PC always has at least one.",
        "Drive": "The fundamental motivation that keeps your PC going through fear and pain (e.g., looking for a loved one, fear of dying). Drive can be used once per session to gain a +2 modifier on a skill roll. A PC might lose their Drive if they fail to handle their fear.",
        "Anchors": "Two important people in the group (one NPC, one other PC) whom your PC trusts and loves, and who help them maintain internal balance and relieve stress. Losing an Anchor can cause a PC to 'fall apart' or become 'Shattered'. You can gain new Anchors by demonstrating reliance and trust in others."
      },
      "Characteristics": {
        "Attributes": "Four core strengths/weaknesses: Strength (toughness), Agility (coordination), Wits (intellectual capacity), and Empathy (understanding others). PCs distribute 13 points, with a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 (or 5 for their archetype's key attribute).",
        "Skills": "Twelve acquired knowledge/experience areas, three per attribute, with levels from 0 to 5. PCs distribute 12 points, with a starting maximum of 2 in any skill (or 3 for their archetype's main skill).",
        "Talents": "Special tricks, traits, or abilities that provide benefits or allow unique actions. Each talent has a prerequisite (a past event) that must be met to acquire it.",
        "HealthPoints": "All PCs and NPCs have three Health points. Losing them results in being 'Broken' and suffering a critical injury."
      },
      "ExperienceAndAdvancement": "Experience Points (XP) are earned by participating in sessions and answering specific questions about character actions and learning. XP can be used to buy new talents or increase skill points (max 5)."
    },
    "GameMechanics": {
      "DiceAndConflicts": {
        "SixSidedDice": "The game uses only six-sided dice. Skill rolls involve rolling a number of dice equal to an attribute score plus a skill level; a 6 on any die is a 'success'. Most tasks require only one success.",
        "PushingTheRoll": "If a roll fails, a player can 'push' it, re-rolling non-successes but taking one 'stress point' and adding a 'stress die' to the re-roll. Pushing is allowed once per roll.",
        "StressDice": "Represent stress points. For each stress point, one stress die is added to all skill rolls. Stress increases focus but also risk of 'messing up'. Rolling a 1 on a stress die ('rolling a walker') means messing up and prevents further pushing.",
        "MessingUp": "Generally means raising the Threat Level by one or suffering a single walker attack. The GM decides how the PC messes up, allowing players to describe it in character. Messing up can also involve running out of resources, offending someone, hurting oneself, breaking something, getting lost, or losing a hostage.",
        "OtherDiceRolls": {
          "D66": "Rolling two six-sided dice, one for tens and one for ones (e.g., 3 and 6 is 36). Used for consulting tables.",
          "D666": "Rolling three six-sided dice for hundreds, tens, and ones.",
          "RandomDie": "Everyone rolls a die; the lowest result is the target (e.g., for a walker bite).",
          "LuckyDie": "GM rolls a die to determine a chance outcome, with odds stated (e.g., 2 in 6 for an unlocked door)."
        }
      },
      "SkillsAndTalents": {
        "UsingSkills": "Skills are linked to attributes. The number of dice rolled is the sum of the skill level and its associated attribute. Modifiers from talents, items, or help add/subtract dice. Players describe their PC's goal before rolling.",
        "FailedTests": "Failing a skill test means not achieving the desired result, though the GM might allow partial success.",
        "SkillList": "Includes Close Combat (Strength), Endure (Strength), Force (Strength), Mobility (Agility), Ranged Combat (Agility), Stealth (Agility), Scout (Wits), Survival (Wits), Tech (Wits), Leadership (Empathy), Manipulation (Empathy), and Medicine (Empathy).",
        "HelpingEachOther": "Other PCs or NPCs (if Trained, Expert, or Master in the skill) can provide a +1 bonus to a skill roll, up to a maximum of +3.",
        "OpposedRolls": "Used when characters compete or work against each other. Both roll, and the one with more successes wins. Extra successes beyond what's needed to win can increase the effect.",
        "ExtremeDifficulty": "For almost impossible tasks, the GM may require more than one success to achieve the goal."
      },
      "CombatAndHealing": {
        "Duels": "Fights between two or a few combatants, resolved with opposed skill rolls (Close Combat or Ranged Combat). Winner inflicts weapon damage. Cover provides defense against ranged attacks. Defenseless targets automatically take damage with extra successes adding more damage. Movement can involve seeking cover or changing range with a Mobility roll.",
        "Brawls": "For larger, more complicated fights, using a combat map and combat rounds divided into six phases (Taking Cover, Ranged Combat, Close Combat, Movement, First Aid, Other).",
        "DamageAndHealing": "PCs and NPCs have 3 Health Points. Losing all Health results in being 'Broken' and suffering a 'critical injury'. Natural recovery is one Health point per day with sufficient rations. First aid requires a Medicine roll to get a Broken character back on their feet, but the critical injury remains. Armor provides an Armor Level (dice rolled to reduce damage) and a penalty to Mobility.",
        "CriticalInjuries": "Suffered when Broken, imposing a penalty on all skill rolls. Some are lethal and require stabilization with specific medical gear (basic or advanced) within a time limit, otherwise leading to death. Recovery time for non-lethal injuries or adapting to permanent impairment varies.",
        "RelievingStress": "Stress can be relieved through social interactions (one point per interaction) or by spending an hour or more with an Anchor (all stress relieved once per session). Undisturbed sleep also relieves stress.",
        "OtherHazards": "Includes explosions (Blast Power, Mobility to negate damage), poison (Toxicity, Endure roll to resist), disease (Virulence, Endure roll to resist), falling (damage based on height, Mobility to reduce), traps (Scout to discover, Mobility to avoid, Tech to disarm, can cause damage, poison, etc.), and starvation/tiredness (stress or damage from failing Endure rolls).",
        "Gear": "Items, weapons, and rations are essential for survival. Encumbrance slots determine carrying capacity (Strength + 2). Items can provide a 'gear bonus' to skill rolls. All items eventually break or wear out and can be repaired as projects. Ammunition is not tracked granularly but can run out as a Challenge or result of messing up.",
        "Weapons": "Close combat weapons (e.g., knife, axe, sledgehammer) and ranged weapons (e.g., pistol, rifle, shotgun, Molotov cocktail). Damage ratings and bonuses are specified.",
        "Vehicles": "Vehicles have Maneuverability (gear bonus), Damage (for ramming), Hull (Health points), and Armor. They can run out of fuel as a Challenge or when messing up. Vehicles can ram opponents or objects (Crash Objects table).",
        "FightingTheDead": "Walkers have no skills or attributes, their threat is measured by 'Threat Level' (0-6) and 'Swarm Size' (1-6). Threat Level increases with noise or failing to avoid walkers. It can be reduced by waiting or distractions. Single walker attacks are resolved with one skill roll. Swarm combat involves group skill rolls against 'Swarm Threat' (Swarm Size + Threat Level). Winning reduces Threat Level or Swarm Size. Losing increases Threat Level/Swarm Size or triggers a Swarm Attack (Single Attack, Block, Mass Attack)."
      }
    },
    "HomeAndAway": {
      "TheHaven": "A temporary or permanent safe home base for the PCs and NPC survivors. Havens have 'Capacity' (how many people it can sustain) and 'Defense' (how well-protected it is) ratings (0-6). Havens also have 'Issues' (problems or weak spots), which can be secret.",
      "NPCSurvivors": "PCs start with five NPC survivors in their haven. NPCs have Issues, but generally no attributes, skills, or talents, with the GM rolling four dice for their skill use (bonuses for Trained, Expert, Master). If a PC dies, a player can convert an NPC survivor into a new PC.",
      "Projects": "Capacity and Defense can be improved by completing projects (e.g., planting crops, building walls) which require time, workforce, Tech skill, and resources. PCs can also teach skills to NPCs or build/repair gear.",
      "Runs": "Leaving the haven to scavenge for supplies, find new havens, attack other groups, or seek a cure. Travel is managed with an 'area map' divided into 10x10 km sectors. PCs travel by foot or vehicle. Entering a new sector requires a Scout roll to spot dangers. Rations must be consumed daily outside the haven. Hunting and scavenging allow finding food and other resources. Locating specific items involves a Survival roll."
    },
    "RunningTheGame": {
      "GMRole": "The GM prepares and runs the campaign, defining NPCs, factions, locations, and orchestrating Challenges.",
      "CampaignPreparations": "Involves jointly deciding on an area map, campaign type (free play or season play), creating PCs and five NPC survivors with relationships, and defining the PCs' starting haven. The GM alone prepares factions (name, number, type, leadership, assets, needs, issues, haven, key NPCs, endgame), secret Issues for NPCs and the haven, Challenge lists, random events, faction encounters, other locations, and walker swarms. A rumor table is also prepared to introduce unknown elements.",
      "SessionStructure": "Sessions begin with an optional 'Dearly Departed Monologue' from one PC recounting previous events. The GM sets scenes by describing the 'when' and 'where' and the situation. Not everything is played out; the GM summarizes less interesting parts. Sessions end by asking XP questions and checking for fear rolls. Flashback scenes can be initiated to explore PC backstories.",
      "Challenges": "The GM's main tool to drive the story, arising from Issues, haven needs, or random events. Challenges escalate if not addressed.",
      "GMTips": "Focus on descriptive details, use themes, ask player questions, add twists, use voice/body language for NPCs, let players name things, use sound/silence, vary pacing, use contrasts, mind time, draw maps, and let the world change. The GM's key phrase is 'What do you do?' to give players initiative. NPCs should be treated as important characters, not pawns. Horror is created by describing the apocalypse, showing death, fostering loss of hope, making walkers truly scary (not jokes), and portraying humans as the 'real monsters'. TV franchise characters can be included but should not overshadow the PCs."
    },
    "SurvivalModeScenarios": {
      "Nature": "Short, pre-written dramatic situations, often completed in one or two sessions. They typically feature pre-generated PCs and clear links to the TV franchise (characters, locations).",
      "Design": "Involves defining a main Challenge, minor Challenges, the PCs' goal, time/place, drawing maps, creating NPCs, placing walkers, determining an endgame, and creating pre-generated PCs with scenario-specific Issues and Drives. Scenarios are designed to be difficult, but PCs should not die in the first scenes."
    },
    "SoloPlay": {
      "Purpose": "Guidelines, procedures, tables, and advice for playing without a GM, either alone or with friends where the GM role is ignored. Can also be used by GMs for improvisation.",
      "CharacterCreationTweaks": "To offset the danger of solo play, PCs start with 14 skill points (instead of 12), a second free talent, a knife if no melee weapon, and Anchors assigned to Haven NPCs.",
      "Companion": "One Haven NPC is designated as a close tie, serving a supporting role. If the Main PC dies, the Companion can be upgraded to a new Main PC.",
      "Tools": {
        "LuckOracle": "Used to answer yes/no questions that would typically be asked of a GM, with odds (Likely, Unlikely, 50/50) determining the dice rolled.",
        "ThemeOracle": "A D666 table used to generate more detail or make sense of situations (locations, people, ideas).",
        "MessingUpOracle": "A D66 table used to determine the consequence of 'messing up' a skill roll, providing varied results beyond attracting walkers.",
        "ProgressClocks": "Six-segment clocks used to track the progression of rumors, factions, and the endgame. Segments are filled based on D6 rolls at the start of each solo session."
      },
      "Preparation": "Involves choosing an unreliable gridded map, creating NPC survivors (randomly or from existing groups), defining relationships, creating a Haven (with Capacity, Defense, Issues, and a starting project), generating a known faction, and creating starting rumors and Challenges.",
      "Procedures": {
        "SessionStructure": "A solo session involves checking/updating clocks, creating new rumors, updating Haven projects, activating a Challenge, running a scene for the Challenge, engaging with it (e.g., a 'run'), then returning to Haven for XP and rest.",
        "Travel": "Similar to GM-led games, involving Scout rolls for new sectors and rolling for encounters (NPCs, walker swarms, or factions).",
        "ExploringBuildings": "Buildings are abstracted as small, normal, or large, avoiding battlemaps for speed. Random Threat Levels are rolled per section/floor, and Luck Oracle is used for scavenging.",
        "PlayerFacingRolls": "Opposed rolls are modified so only the player rolls, converting NPC skill levels to difficulty levels (successes required). This makes combat faster and deadlier.",
        "SoloCombat": "Primarily uses duel rules. When outnumbered, each extra opponent increases difficulty and potential damage. Chases are player-facing Mobility rolls.",
        "SoloingTheSwarm": "When losing to a swarm, a D6 roll determines whether Threat Level or Swarm Size increases, or the Swarm attacks. Swarm attacks are randomized by D6 roll to determine type (Single Attack, Block, Mass Attack).",
        "Endgame": "The campaign ends when the 'endgame' is either resolved or its clock fills, leading to a conclusion determined by Theme and Luck Oracles."
